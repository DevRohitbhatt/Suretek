                <p><span >The Company offers a seven (7) day, 100% money back, Satisfaction Guarantee to all Members.</span></p>
                <p><span >Except as otherwise required by applicable law, during the first seven (7) days from the date of your initial product or service enrollment or payment (whichever occurs first), you may cancel your Eaconomy Membership Agreement without penalty and receive a 100% refund of all Membership fees paid.</span></p>
                <p><span >Except as otherwise required by applicable law, after seven (7) days you may cancel your Membership at any time in accordance with the terms of the Membership Agreement terms but you will not be eligible to receive a refund of fees paid.</span></p>
                <p><strong><span >Refund Process:</span></strong></p>
                <p><span >Refunds will be issued to the payment method used for your original purchase. All refunds are processed and paid in US dollars. We do not accept responsibility for any international transaction fees or exchange rate fluctuations that may impact the refund amount received by a Member.</span></p>
                <p><span >If we receive multiple refund requests related to a series of connected or associated accounts and/or patterned enrollment and refund requests in connection with Member accounts, we reserve the right to suspend the accounts in question and investigate the circumstances of such refund requests prior to making any refund.</span></p>
                <p><strong><span >Chargebacks:</span></strong></p>
                <p><span >In order to combat potential fraud our policy on chargeback is as follows:<br/>
                Once a chargeback occurs with respect to a Member account, that Member account will be suspended.</span></p>
                <p><span >Fraud alerts and requests for information (i.e., cardholder or card-issuing bank querying authenticity) may be treated the same way as chargebacks.<br/>
                If multiple chargebacks happen with respect to the same Member account, we reserve the right to terminate that Member account.</span></p>
                <p><span >This Refund Policy does not apply to Affiliate Marketing Kit (“AMK”) enrollments which are subject to the terms of the AMK / ISP Agreement and Policies and Procedures.</span></p>
